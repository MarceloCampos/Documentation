[![Sitcore SC20260](images/sc20260Board.jpg)]

## Overview
The Sitcore SoC is a low cost way to add .NET computing power to any embedded product. Available as either a 100 pin LQFP or a 265 ball BGA, the Sitcore SoC let's you design IoT products that are secure, easily integrated with the cloud, and can be easily managed and updated from the cloud for deployments of one to a million or more.

## Ordering Part Number
* 100 Pin LQFP: SC20100
* 265 Ball BGA: SC20260
