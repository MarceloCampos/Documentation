TinyCLR Config is a stand-alone tool to help manage TinyCLR OS devices. The tool is cloud-connected. It automatically finds and downloads newer firmware versions from a list of provided sources. These sources can be on the Internet or local on your computer if you don't have (or don't want) Internet access. The firmware update functionality only works for devices that have [GHI Electronics Bootloader v2](bootloader.md).

You can download TinyCLR Config from the TinyCLR Config section of the [Downloads](downloads.md) page.
