TinyCLR Config is a stand-alone tool to help manage TinyCLR OS devices, including firmware installation and creating encrypted application deployments and loading them onto SITCore devices. There is also a Debug panel that shows any debug data coming from the connected device.

You can download TinyCLR Config from the [Downloads](downloads.md) page.

## Connecting a Device

When TinyCLR Config opens, you will notice a `Device` section near the top of its window. Connect your device to your PC's USB port and click on the `Select a device` drop down text box. The name of your device should appear. Click on the device and hit the `Connect` button.

Once your device is connected, you can ping the device using the `Ping` command in the `Utilities` menu. In the `Assemblies` menu there is an `Assemblies Listing` command that will list all the assemblies installed on the connected device along with their version number. There is also an option in the `Utilities` menu to reboot the device.

## Managing Firmware

TinyCLR Config can be used to install new firmware on a connected device. The firmware is the TinyCLR software installed on your device that runs and manages your application program.

To update your firmware, click on the `...` button to the left of the `Update Firmware` button. A dialog box will open so you can select your firmware file. Only .ghi and .glb files will be recognized. After selecting your firmware file, click on the `Update Firmware` button to copy it to your device.

In the `Erase` menu, the `Erase All` selection will erase the firmware on the device, but will also erase the application. While it's not necessary to delete the firmware or the application to install new firmware, it can help if your device stops working properly.

## Managing Your Application

TinyCLR Config lets you create and deploy encrypted application files. A key is needed to install an encrypted application deployment file on your device. This key can be generated by TinyCLR Config or provided by the you.

### Creating a Deployment File

To create an encrypted deployment, you must first have the application installed on your device and the device must be connected to TinyCLR Config. A key is needed to encrypt your deployment file. Either enter a key into the key text box (hexadecimal pairs delimited by hyphens) or just press the `Generate Key` button to generate a random key.

If you want to add a version number to your deployment, enter it in the `Version of created app:` text box.

Click on the `...` button next to the `Create App` button and select a directory and enter a filename for your deployment file. Now press the `Create App` button. The encrypted deployment file and a text file with the key will be saved in the directory you selected.

### Installing a Deployment File

To install an encrypted deployment file on your device, first use TinyCLR Config to connect to your device. Click on the `...` button next to the `Update App` button and select the deployment file (should have a .tca extension). Enter the correct key in the text box next to the `Generate Key` button. The key is a series of hexadecimal pairs that are separated by hyphens. Now click on the `Update App` button. If the key matches the deployment file, the application will be deployed to your device.
