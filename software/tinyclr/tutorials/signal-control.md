## Pulse Feedback

The PulseFeedback class can be used in three different modes. The image below shows an example pin capture for each of the modes. It is not drawn to scale. The area marked by the arrows is the time measured for each mode. Remember that the pulse and echo may be on separate pins.

The first mode is EchoDuration. This mode sends a pulse of a given length and state over the provided pin. It then waits for an echo on the other specified pin and measures how long that echo pulse was. The echo and pulse pin can be the same pin if desired. 

The next mode is DurationUntilEcho. It is very similar to EchoDuration, although instead of sending a pulse and measuring the length of the resulting echo, it measures how long it takes until that echo is received.

The final mode is DrainDuration. This mode is often used in capacitive touch. When calling Read, the pulse line will be held in the specified state for the specified time and then set to an input. When a resistor and capacitor are connected to this pin and ground, the pin will fall to ground after a short period of time dependent on the capacitance on the pin. The image below shows a sample circuit. Note that this mode can only be used with a single pin.

The following example illustrates sending a pulse of 10us and reading an echo on a second pin where both the pulse and echo are high, without using any pull-up or pull-down resistors. It prints out the total duration of the echo. It repeats every 250ms.

```cs
var pulse = new PulseFeedback
    (SC20260.GpioPin.PD2, SC20260.GpioPin.PD7, PulseFeedbackMode.EchoDuration) {

    DisableInterrupts = false,
    Timeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1),
    PulseLength = TimeSpan.FromTicks(100),
    PulsePinValue = GpioPinValue.High,
    EchoPinValue = GpioPinValue.High,
    PulsePinDriveMode = GpioPinDriveMode.Input,
    EchoPinDriveMode = GpioPinDriveMode.Input
};

while (true) {
    Debug.WriteLine(pulse.GeneratePulse().TotalMilliseconds.ToString("N0"));

    Thread.Sleep(250);
}
```

Here is a code sample to read an HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor. The ReadDistance method returns the distance in centimeters.

```cs
this.pulseFeedback = new PulseFeedback(distanceTrigPin, distanceEchoPin,
    PulseFeedbackMode.EchoDuration) {

    DisableInterrupts = false,
    Timeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1),
    PulseLength = TimeSpan.FromTicks(100),
    PulsePinValue = GpioPinValue.High,
    EchoPinValue = GpioPinValue.High,
    PulsePinDriveMode = GpioPinDriveMode.Output,
    EchoPinDriveMode = GpioPinDriveMode.Input
};
    
public int ReadDistance() {
    var time = this.pulseFeedback.GeneratePulse();
    var microsecond = time.TotalMilliseconds * 1000.0;
    var distance = microsecond * 0.036 / 2;

    return (int)distance;
}
```






## Signal Capture

The SignalCapture class monitors a pin and records any changes (high-low or low-high transitions) of the pin to an array. It is a digital waveform recorder. Each array element is the number of microseconds between each signal change.

When calling Read, it blocks other code from executing until it either fills the input buffer or it has captured the number of transitions specified by the count argument. If your signal is shorter than that, the call will never return. Make sure to request only what you plan to capture.

The following sample code captures the signal generated by pressing LDR button on the SC20100S Dev board. It will attempt to capture 100 transitions, waiting no more than 10 seconds. It will also enable the pull-up resistor on the pin. It will return the initial state of the pin when it started capturing and how many transitions it captured. Note that the signal capture may record button bounces, resulting in a number of transitions in rapid succession.

```cs
var cap = new SignalCapture(SC20100.GpioPin.PE3);
var buffer = new TimeSpan[100];

cap.DisableInterrupts = false;
cap.Timeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10);
cap.DriveMode = GpioPinDriveMode.InputPullUp;

while (true) {
    var count = cap.Read(out var init, buffer);

    Thread.Sleep(100);
}
```

## Signal Generator

SignalGenerator is a digital waveform generator. SignalGenerator works by comparing an internal counter to an array of time values, one by one. When the value of the argument matches the counter, the output pin is changed. The time values are in microseconds.

SignalGenerator can also be used to generate PWM. Unlike the PWM class, SignalGenerator can be used to generate PWM on any available output pin. It does use processor time -- the higher the frequency the more processor time it uses.

At this time, SignalGenerator only operates in blocking mode. While SignalGenerator is running, it will not yield any processor time to other code.

The following sample code will blink the user LED on the SC20100S Dev board four times (for one second each time) every five seconds.

```cs
var gen = new SignalGenerator(SC20100.GpioPin.PE11);

var buffer = new[] {
    TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1),
    TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1),
    TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1),
    TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1),
    TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1),
    TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1),
    TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1),
    TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1),
};

gen.DisableInterrupts = false;
gen.IdleValue = GpioPinValue.Low;

while (true) {
    gen.Write(buffer);

    Thread.Sleep(5000);
}
```
