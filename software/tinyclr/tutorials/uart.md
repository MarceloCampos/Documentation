# UART 
---
Serial data ports, called UARTs, transfer data between devices using two pins: TXD (transmit data) and RXD (receive data). UART stands for Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter. Asynchronous means there is no clock signal to synchronize the two devices. The devices agree on a data rate, called the baud rate, and send a start bit the beginning of each transmitted character to keep the devices synchronized.

The easiest way to test a UART is by wiring a device's TXD to its RXD so any transmitted data is received by the same device. This is called a "loopback" test. The following code performs a simple loopback test on the SITCore SC20100S Dev Board. If you connect PE7, the COM7 RX pin, directly to the PE8, the COM7 TX pin, you will see "ABCDEF" in the output window when running this code.

```cs
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading;
using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.Uart;
using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Pins;

class Program {
    private static void Main() {
        var txBuffer = new byte[] { 0x41, 0x42, 0x43, 0x44, 0x45, 0x46 }; //A, B, C, D, E, F
        var rxBuffer = new byte[txBuffer.Length];

        var myUart = UartController.FromName(SC20100.UartPort.Uart7);

        myUart.SetActiveSettings(9600, 8, UartParity.None, UartStopBitCount.One,
            UartHandshake.None);

        myUart.Enable();
        myUart.Write(txBuffer, 0, txBuffer.Length);

        while (true) {
            if (myUart.BytesToRead > 0) {
                var bytesReceived = myUart.Read(rxBuffer, 0, myUart.BytesToRead);
                Debug.WriteLine(Encoding.UTF8.GetString(rxBuffer, 0, bytesReceived));
            }

            Thread.Sleep(20);
        }
    }
}

```

## Event Handlers
TinyCLR's UART API included the following event listeners:

* ClearToSendChanged
* DataReceived
* ErrorReceived

The following example is written for the SC20100S Dev Board. It works the same as the previous example, except it uses the DataReceived event. If you connect PE7, the COM7 RX pin, directly to the PE8, the COM7 TX pin, you will see "ABCDEF" in the output window when running this code.

```cs
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading;
using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.Uart;
using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Pins;

class Program {
    private static byte[] txBuffer;
    private static byte[] rxBuffer;
    private static UartController myUart;

    private static void Main() {
        txBuffer = new byte[] { 0x41, 0x42, 0x43, 0x44, 0x45, 0x46 }; //A, B, C, D, E, F
        rxBuffer = new byte[txBuffer.Length];

        myUart = UartController.FromName(SC20100.UartPort.Uart7);

        myUart.SetActiveSettings(9600, 8, UartParity.None, UartStopBitCount.One,
            UartHandshake.None);

        myUart.Enable();

        myUart.DataReceived += MyUart_DataReceived;

        myUart.Write(txBuffer, 0, txBuffer.Length);

        while (true)
            Thread.Sleep(20);
    }

    private static void MyUart_DataReceived(UartController sender, DataReceivedEventArgs e) {
        var bytesReceived = myUart.Read(rxBuffer, 0, e.Count);
        Debug.WriteLine(Encoding.UTF8.GetString(rxBuffer, 0, bytesReceived));
    }
}

```

## RS232
UART uses the processor's voltage levels (logic levels) for transferring data. On the SITCore this is 0 to 3.3 volts. In the early days of computers, UARTs used -12 to +12 volts to communicate reliably over longer distances. This is known as the RS232 standard.

Some PCs still include serial ports, but those are RS232 serial ports. A voltage level shifter is needed to properly connect a logic level UART to an RS232 device.
