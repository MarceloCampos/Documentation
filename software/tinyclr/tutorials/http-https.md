# HTTP/HTTPS
---
Hyper Text Transport Protocol (HTTP) builds on top of the [Core Protocols](core-protocols.md) to provide a standard way to work with web servers.

```
// fetch www.google.com home page
…
```

Secure connections similarly work, through the built in [TLS](tls.md) support.

HTTPS can also be used to send data to a cloud, such as [Azure](azure.md).
