Similar data can often be handled more efficiently when stored and manipulated as a collection. You can use the System.Array class or the classes in the System.Collections, System.Collections.Generic, System.Collections.Concurrent, System.Collections.Immutable namespaces to add, remove, and modify either individual elements or a range of elements in a collection.
