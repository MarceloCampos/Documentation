# Debugging
---
Debug a tiny IoT device just like you would on a full PC. You can easily debug your code from within Visual Studio over USB or Serial. Set breakpoints, step through code, and examine variables without the need for specialized hardware or software.

On power up, the system checks a pin called MODE to determine select the debug interface, USB vs Serial.

Information on using the debugger can be found in Microsoft's documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/debugger-feature-tour?view=vs-2019).
