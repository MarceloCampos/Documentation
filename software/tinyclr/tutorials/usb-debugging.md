# USB Debugging
---
You can easily debug your code from within Visual Studio over USB. Set breakpoints, step through code, and examine variables without the need for specialized hardware or software. Information on using the debugger can be found in Microsoft's documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/debugger-feature-tour?view=vs-2019).
