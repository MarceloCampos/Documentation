# NuGet
---
All libraries are hosted in the cloud using the industry standard NuGet format. Not only is it easy to install and upgrade libraries, it is also easy to create and publish libraries of your own.

Information on adding NuGet Libraries to your application can be found on the [Getting Started](../getting-started.md) page.

For information on creating your own NuGet Packages, [this page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/create-packages/creating-a-package) from Microsoft is a good place to start.
