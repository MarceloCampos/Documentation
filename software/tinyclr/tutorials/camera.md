# Camera Interface
---
For devices with digital camera interface, sometimes called DCMI or DCI, TinyCLR OS includes the necessary drivers. Typically, cameras need to be configured using [I2C bus](i2c.md). Please refer to the camera’s manuals to determine the needed configuration.

This example configures and shows the camera on the display on the SCM20260D Dev Board.
