# Roadmap

![Roadmap](images/roadmap-noborder.jpg)

We've shipped [TinyCLR 1.0](https://forums.ghielectronics.com/t/starting-the-new-year-with-tinyclr-os-1-0/21895/) and have begun to work on the next version. We will continue to evaluate stability and may issue some bug-fix only releases like a 1.0.1.

The bulk of our effort is going towards the next major release where we plan to investigate commercial features like In-Field Update, USB Host and USB Client and networking -- specifically a built-in networking and TLS stack with drivers for our Ethernet PHYs and perhaps also some WiFi modules. Previews for these features will start landing over the next few months.

Longer term we do plan to investigate support for generics and a fully conforming ECMA-335 implementation and, once we have that, alignment with .NET Standard.
 
Keep in mind that all of this is subject to change and does not include many smaller improvements and features. We may change what features we plan to deliver, drop some entirely, or change when they get delivered.
